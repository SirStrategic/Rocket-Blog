Assume constant thrust and constant fuel burn, only force is thrust. Impulse to payload is given by integral from 0 to t_t of F x M_f/M dt. M = Mo - t/t_t x deltaM then integrate this expression and equate with M_f x v_f. solve to get expression, v_f = ln|Mo/Mf|xFxt_t/deltaM. This is equivelant to v_f = ln|Mo/Mf| x Is x go.
the rational here is that the infinitecimal impulse is equally distributed accross the payload and remaining fuel.
