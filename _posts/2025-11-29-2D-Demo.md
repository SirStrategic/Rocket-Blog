title: "Very simple solver for 2d constant force newtonian motion"

I've written an unremarkable program to approximate newton's equation F=MA in 2D in python.
At the moment only constant forces are implemented and it is painfully slow due to the use of python loops.
Euler's method is used to approximate (here effectivly perfectly) the velocity and the quadrature rule is used to find the position. Due to the use of quadature, the error in position is proportional to step size for this constant acceleration scenario.
Once I develop this further I will make a public repository.
TODO
<ul>
  <li>reimplement this whole thing with classes for future flexiblity</li>
  <li>Add simple drag forces</li>
  <li>Time dependant mass and thrust</li>
  <li>describe rocket as physical object with moments etc, such that more advanced aerodynamics and dynamics can be modeled </li>
</ul>
